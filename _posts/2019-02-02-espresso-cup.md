In fall semester 2018/2019, I had the chance to undergo an entire product development process. Though I am more focused on graphic and interaction design, it was one of my favorite projects in that semester.

The task was to design an espresso cup that could be 3D printed with porcelain. [Josefine Bloch](https://instagr.am/jozebel) and I designed a cup and a saucer that can be used in households as well as in the catering industry. We replaced the cupâ€™s handle with a textured surface that can be printed without overhang. The saucer offers space for a spoon and sugar without wasting space horizontally.

To examine and improve the size, ergonomics and look of the cup, we printed prototypes made out of PLA.
