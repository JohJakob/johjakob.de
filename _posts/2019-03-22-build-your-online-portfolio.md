During the last semester break, I conducted a four day workshop together with [Felix Koppe](https://instagr.am/flxkpe). We wanted to give other students the opportunity to create an online portfolio from scratch in the form of a modern, responsive and fast website. In my opinion, an online portfolio is vital to their careers as designers.

Felix and I taught the basics of HTML, CSS and the easy-to-use content management system [Vapid](https://vapid.com), gave advice on how to create a basic HTML structure and manage content, and helped making more complex layouts. Even though the majority of the attendees have never worked with web technologies before, the end results were remarkable.

Due to the tight time schedule, we could not publish the websites. We are trying to help the participants with that individually. The following list contains all websites that have been published so far:
