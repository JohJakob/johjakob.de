<article class="article-col-5" markdown="1">

In times of online music streaming services and playlists, Shellac takes a step back and focuses on offline content and individual artists.

Shellac displays all albums the user has locally stored on their device. Tapping on a cover starts playing the desired album. The only playback control is a play/pause button, but the user can still skip songs via the headphone remote or Control Center.

I started developing the app in December 2017 as a side project. When I have spare time, I work on it.
