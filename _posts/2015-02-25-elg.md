Made for the students, their parents and the teachers of my former secondary school _Elisabeth-Gymnasium Halle_, ELG offers easy and fast access to information on teacher substitutions and cancelled lessons, the latest news and the timetable.

Since the release of the first version in 2012, I have been developing the app further and optimizing it for the latest software and hardware. Being the first app I made, it was also my first step into interface and graphic design.
