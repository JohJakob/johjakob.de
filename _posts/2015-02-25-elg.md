ELG was made for students, their parents, and teachers of my former secondary school _Elisabeth-Gymnasium Halle_. The app offers quick access to information on teacher substitutions and cancelled lessons, the latest news, and the individual schedule.

Since the release of the first version in 2012, I have been further developing and optimizing it for the latest software and hardware. Being the first app I made, it was also my first step into interface and graphic design.
