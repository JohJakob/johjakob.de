In collaboration with Christian Kirchner, I created a specimen booklet about the typeface _Univers_ that was designed by Adrian Frutiger in 1957.

Among details about the typeface and its designer, the booklet features a cut out title on the cover and a foldout polyptych halfway through, revealing an illustration of the solar system that showcases _Univers_â€™s different weights.
