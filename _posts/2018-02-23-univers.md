_Univers_ is one of the most popular sans-serif typefaces and is known for its elegant simplicity. Clear and objective forms make it a very legible font family that is suitable for essiantially any typographic need.

In collaboration with Christian Kirchner, I created a specimen booklet about this typeface that was designed by Adrian Frutiger in 1957.

We decided on designing a universe-themed booklet and had a special feature in mind: a foldout polyptych halfway through, revealing an illustration of the solar system that showcases Universâ€™s different weights.
