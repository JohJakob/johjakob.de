<span class="span-cloud">cloud</span> is a concept for building a student community and creating a platform for different people to connect and interchange at [Anhalt University](https://hs-anhalt.de/en). It was established by Mathilde Scholz and [Hannes Wilke](https://hanneswilke.de) in 2016. The self-organized student room is a place to get together, work, discuss, or simply have a coffee.

It is voluntarily managed by a group of students called admins who keep everything in order, organize events and workshops, and further improve the <span class="span-cloud">cloud</span>.

I joined the <span class="span-cloud">cloud</span> admins at the beginning of my first year. Currently, I run _type talk_, an event series about typography and graphic design, take care of the <span class="span-cloud">cloud</span>â€™s social media accounts, and develop a [website](https://cloud-dessau.org) to improve our communication and connect to more people.
