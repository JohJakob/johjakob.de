Every summer, the first year students prepare the welcoming of new students at _Dessau Department of Design_ starting in fall. Part of this preparation is the creation of the “Survival Guide”, a brochure containing useful advice on how to study and live in the city of Dessau.

In 2018, I took over this task and designed a leaflet providing essential information about the campus’s studios and workshops, different student societies, where to eat, clubs and bars, and more. On the flip side, a map of Dessau’s inner city is shown with the most relevant locations labeled.
