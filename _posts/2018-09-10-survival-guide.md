Every summer, the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester students prepare the welcoming of new students starting in the fall semester. One part of this preparation is the creation of a so-called “Survival Guide”, a brochure with useful information on how to study and live in Dessau.

Last year, I took over this task and designed a leaflet providing important information about the workshops, different student groups, where to eat, clubs and bars in Dessau etc. on one side and a map of Dessau’s inner city and the most relevant locations on the other side.
