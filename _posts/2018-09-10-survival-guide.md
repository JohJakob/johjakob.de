Every summer, the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester students prepare the welcoming of new students at Dessau Department of Design. Part of this preparation is the creation of the “Survival Guide”, a brochure containing useful information on how to study and live in the city of Dessau.

Last year, I took over this task and designed a leaflet providing important information about the campus’s studios and workshops, different student societies, where to eat, clubs and bars in the Bauhaus city, and more on one side, and a map of Dessau’s inner city with the most relevant locations on the other side.
